# Bureau Loan Prediction Assignment

This repository contains the implementation of a two-wheeler loan prediction model using a Random Forest Classifier. The goal is to predict whether a loan application will be accepted or declined based on the provided dataset.

## Repository Structure
- **Dataset/**: Contains the training and test data used for model development.
- **Output/**: Stores generated predictions and output files.
- **Report/**: Includes the final report detailing the approach, insights, and performance metrics.
- **Code.ipynb**: Jupyter notebook with data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/piyush-mk/Bureau-Loan.git
## Usage
Run the Code.ipynb notebook to train the model and generate predictions on the test data.
View the final report in the Report/ folder for detailed insights.
